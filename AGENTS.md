# AGENTS.md

DeepSeek Harness is a plugin-based agent harness on vendored Cordis: **everything is a plugin**. Read [docs/architecture.md](docs/architecture.md) before changing `packages/`; follow [docs/AGENTS.md](docs/AGENTS.md) for documentation.

## Pre-release stance: foundation over blast radius

**Remove this section at the first tagged release.** With no external consumers, prefer the correct foundation over compatibility shims: rename or repackage freely and update every reference together. Backends reject old on-disk formats. SQLite uses monotonic `SCHEMA_VERSION`; `dsh-session` keeps `SESSION_FORMAT_VERSION` at `0` with no compatibility promise.

## Commands

[`package.json`](package.json) and [scripts/run-gates.ts](scripts/run-gates.ts) own the script inventory; [development.md](docs/development.md) owns setup, demos, and CI.

```sh
pnpm install            # pnpm workspaces, node ^22.19 || >=24
pnpm run clean           # remove build outputs and safe residue from deleted packages
pnpm run test           # vitest unit tests
pnpm run test:coverage  # CI coverage gate: per-file 100% on packages/*/*/src
pnpm run test:e2e       # real-API tests; self-skip without DEEPSEEK_API_KEY
pnpm run test:snapshot  # keyless ACP/headless replay vs expected outputs; filter: -t <name>
pnpm run test:snapshot:record  # re-record expected outputs (needs key)
pnpm run typecheck
pnpm run lint
pnpm run duplication    # cross-file TypeScript clone detection
pnpm run build          # tsc emits lib/types, tsdown bundles runtime
pnpm run hygiene        # knip + publint + workspace constraints + NodeNext consumer check
pnpm run check:windows-wine  # ONLY when diagnosing a known Windows failure (needs wine); CI owns this signal
pnpm run doc-sync       # all documentation gates; leaf list in scripts/run-gates.ts
pnpm run website:build  # VitePress build (doubles as dead-link check)
pnpm dsh --profile headless "task"  # run one task from source (needs DEEPSEEK_API_KEY)
```

### Host sandbox failures

When required `gh`, `pnpm`, build, test, or generator commands fail because the agent sandbox blocks credentials, network, IPC, file watching, or nested `sandbox-exec`, retry unchanged with the narrowest host escalation before diagnosing authentication or project failure. Require sandbox evidence; never bypass genuine test failures or the product sandbox under test.

### Run relevant checks locally

Run checks before pushes via [dsh-pre-push-checks](.agents/skills/dsh-pre-push-checks/SKILL.md); report only commands run. After `gh stack sync`, validate immediately; do not merge before checks pass.

Match evidence to the surface: focused tests for behavior, snapshots for model or user output, `doc-sync` for docs, build/hygiene and built smokes for published paths, and real-API e2e for provider behavior. Never default to the full suite or repeat a passing check for commit or push; CI owns exhaustive coverage and the platform matrix. `test:coverage`, not `test`, is the CI coverage gate ([why](docs/testing.md)).

## Secrets / .env

Real-API tests and demos read `DEEPSEEK_API_KEY`, optional `DEEPSEEK_BASE_URL`, and root `.env`. cordis.yml allows `!!js` (never `!js`) under plugin `config` and entry `disabled`; other metadata stays literal, so conditional composition also uses overlays ([primer](docs/cordis-primer.md#loader-configuration)). Never commit credentials. CI e2e skips without a key; [testing.md](docs/testing.md) owns key policy.

## Conventions

- Every npm package is `@deepseek-ai/dsh-<name>`; vendored packages are rescoped ([mapping](docs/rescope.md)) and `private: true`. `@deepseek-ai/cordis` is a peerDependency (+ dev) of every harness package.
- ESM everywhere (`"type": "module"`): package names across packages, `.ts` in local relative imports. Config subprocesses run built `lib/` under plain Node; source regressions use their declared launcher ([testing policy](docs/testing.md#test-subprocess-launch-modes)). The `dsh` CLI source launch uses tsx's ESM-only hook (`node --import tsx/esm`); modules it reaches stay ESM (no CJS-only exports) — native TypeScript modes are unavailable across the engines range ([source-launch contract](.agents/notes/implemented/architecture/2026-07-29-dsh-source-launch-tsx-esm.md)). Raw/Web `cordis.yml` bare plugins must appear in their resolver manifest's `dependencies`; `verify-cordis-config` enforces it.
- **Registrations are effects**: every contribution goes through `ctx.effect()` / `ctx.on()`; a registry's `register()` returns the disposer.
- **Runtime invariants assert owned relationships.** Check authoritative event streams or mutable data, not service or method presence, plugin metadata or effects, or fixed pure examples. Without a plausible relationship, an explained empty companion is correct ([package invariant rules](packages/AGENTS.md)).
- **Typed events use declaration merging** and merge-extensible maps. Event JSDoc needs `@mode` and payload `@param`; scoped keys absent from payloads need `@dshScopeScan unsupported`. Public service methods document parameters and non-void returns. A `SessionEventMap` member is required-on-read by default — builds that do not know its type refuse the log unless the event carries the envelope's `ignorable: true`; only structural format changes bump `SESSION_FORMAT_VERSION` ([mechanism](.agents/notes/implemented/architecture/2026-08-10-session-log-version-mechanism.md)).
- **Switch on discriminant tags.** Closed unions end in `assertNever`; merge-extensible unions fall through a documented default.
- **Waterfall listeners MUST call `next()`** to delegate; returning without it short-circuits the chain ([semantics](docs/cordis-primer.md#cordis-waterfall-semantics)).
- **Model-visible ⟺ logged**: anything that reaches a model request must be reconstructable from the session log; a new model-visible input requires a session event.
- **Plugins, not loop changes**: new behavior goes on documented extension points; changing `agent-loop` requires updating docs/architecture.md.
- **Overlay frontend plugins:** pick the presentation form, then load its skill before writing — card window [dsh-overlay-web-plugins](.agents/skills/dsh-overlay-web-plugins/SKILL.md) (insert [`ui-float-window`](packages/client/ui-float-window/README.md), `pnpm overlay:new-page <name>` for the body page, occupy `overlay-card.body`; declare `dsh.client.overlayBody`; dual-face host+page is one Loader row so the rail can hide/unplug the whole card); arbitrary-shape floater [dsh-overlay-shaped-plugins](.agents/skills/dsh-overlay-shaped-plugins/SKILL.md); desktop (桌面) [dsh-overlay-canvas-plugins](.agents/skills/dsh-overlay-canvas-plugins/SKILL.md) (insert [`ui-overlay-desktop`](packages/client/ui-overlay-desktop/README.md), `pnpm overlay:new-desktop <name>` for the page, occupy `overlay-desktop.body`; exclusive one occupant). Shaped HOW is a reserved slot; do not invent it or reuse the card. `overlay:live insert` builds `lib/`. Never restart `dsh web`.
- **A capability seam comprises Service Definition / Service Provider / Consumer roles.** It is complete, never one role; split only when roles evolve independently ([glossary](docs/glossary.md#capability-seam)).
- **Prefer maintained dependencies over hand-rolling** when they genuinely delete owned code and tests ([policy](.agents/notes/implemented/process/2026-07-26-dependencies-over-hand-rolling.md)).
- **Explicit > implicit at package boundaries**: defaulting is an explicit `resolve(request): Spec` step in the owning implementation, never a hidden `?? default` inside `run()` (the `dsh-shell` request/spec split is the template).
- **No hardcoded tunables in plugins**: deployment-varying choices are validated `Config` fields changeable from cordis.yml; a `DEFAULT_*` constant or test hook is not configurability. Protocol constants, external specs, and security invariants stay fixed.
- **Misconfiguration fails loud** at load when self-contained, otherwise at the earliest resolvable point; never silently skip a missing referent.
- **Opaque cross-boundary ids are branded** (`Branded<B>` from `dsh-brand`), never bare `string`.
- **Trust TypeScript at typed same-process boundaries.** Do not add runtime validation, fallback behavior, or hostile-input tests solely for values the static interface requires; validate at parser/config, queued, model/tool JSON, durable/file, worker, process, and wire boundaries.
- **Source plane vs artifact plane, never mixed; keep compiler faces explicit.** Static gates and tests resolve workspace imports through tsconfig `paths` to `src` and pass on a clean tree; gates consuming built `lib/` declare that dependency. Each package uses one aggregate except `api/remotes`; repo-wide programs seed a face config, never the root solution ([layout](docs/development.md#typescript-project-layout)).
- **An empty `catch` names what it swallows** and why nothing else can reach it; keep the `try` to one statement.
- **Prefer symmetry for parallel values**; unexplained asymmetry usually signals a missed extraction.
- **Tests describe behavior, not correctness.** Change obsolete behavior with its tests; explain why in the PR.
- **Non-trivial changes MUST include an Agent Note in the same PR;** only mechanical/local edits are exempt ([scope](.agents/notes/README.md#when-to-write-one)). Archived notes are frozen: never edit or treat them as current authority ([archive policy](.agents/notes/README.md#archiving-and-deletion)).
- **Testing policy** — [docs/testing.md](docs/testing.md). Every non-trivial model- or product-user-visible behavior change adds or updates a keyless snapshot through a real runnable example in the same PR; package tests, e2e-only assertions, and mock-only fixtures do not substitute for the assembled application transcript. Fixtures must replay on macOS/Linux; fix fixtures, not normalizers. Plan unit, e2e, and snapshot coverage for capability seams, lifecycle paths, and transcript output; include missing snapshot-harness support in the same change.
- **A tool's UI render intent is part of its design**, decided up front (`generic`/`terminal`/`diff`, `locations`); presentation methods are pure functions of `args` ([cookbook](docs/cookbook/adding-a-tool.md)).
- **Choose PR history deliberately.** Split independent changes; fix the introducing PR before propagation. Standalone PRs and official stacks may merge-forward or rebase after review. Rewrites use `--force-with-lease`, abort on remote movement, never raw `--force`; an in-progress merge-forward preserves its checkpoint before taking a newer base ([rationale](.agents/notes/implemented/process/2026-08-02-native-github-stacks-and-optional-rebases.md)).
- **Labels:** one PR `kind/*`, all material `area/*`, and native Issue Type ([taxonomy](.agents/notes/implemented/process/2026-08-08-unified-github-label-taxonomy.md)).
- TODO markers: `FIXME`/`TODO`/`XXX` by urgency ([semantics](docs/development.md)).
- Files end with exactly one trailing newline; `git diff --cached --check` (pre-commit) gates it.

## Defensive patterns

Read [docs/defensive-patterns.md](docs/defensive-patterns.md) before lifecycle, concurrency, subprocess, or teardown work.

## Type safety and documentation

Everything compiles under `strict: true` with `noImplicitAny`; every remaining `any` explains why narrowing is infeasible. Every module and export has concise JSDoc for its non-obvious contract; function-like exports include `@param`/`@returns` (`verify-export-jsdoc`). Heritage-declared members, plugin-protocol slots, and constructors keep their docs at the declaring Service Definition, protocol, or class.

Comments and docs state complete contracts, not reasoning transcripts: behavior, failure, timing, ownership, and safe-use facts; do not narrate control flow or tests, preserve review history, or restate code. Name actors and facts. Prefer `response fields`, `JSON validation`, or `ESM exports` over `response shape`, `validation boundary`, or `module shape`. Keep `contract` for preconditions, postconditions, invariants, compatibility promises, and other obligations callers rely on. Keep a literal process, wire, security, transaction, or lifecycle boundary. Do not comment on facts obvious from code. Details: [docs/AGENTS.md](docs/AGENTS.md) and [dsh-prose-standard](.agents/skills/dsh-prose-standard/SKILL.md).

Wire mechanically checkable invariants into an executed top-level gate and prove each changed acceptance path rejects an invalid case. Use narrow, justified exceptions instead of disabling a rule globally.

Docs accompany every code change: update affected README and JSDoc contracts together. Routine bilingual work follows [docs/AGENTS.md](docs/AGENTS.md); only explicit user invocation may run `dsh-translate-docs`.

## Editing these instructions

`CLAUDE.md` symlinks `AGENTS.md` at root, `packages/`, and `examples/`; edit the real file. Keep each rule self-contained while linking high-level docs. Condense when clarity survives; raise a `verify-doc-budgets` ceiling when the required content genuinely needs more space.

## Vendoring policy

`vendor/` packages are pinned source copies (manifest with upstream SHAs in [vendor/README.md](vendor/README.md)). Update via the sync procedure there; re-apply or retire the logged local modifications; rerun `pnpm run test && pnpm run build`.
